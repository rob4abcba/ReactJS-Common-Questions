## React Native

188. ### What is the difference between React Native and React?

     **React** is a JavaScript library, supporting both front end web and being run on the server, for building user interfaces and web applications.

     **React Native** is a mobile framework that compiles to native app components, allowing you to build native mobile applications (iOS, Android, and Windows) in JavaScript that allows you to use React to build your components, and implements React under the hood.  
       
       React Native is built using React. React, at its core, is a library for “diffing” a virtual DOM and rendering this DOM to a screen with minimal operations. React, by default, does not have an opinion about which nodes are in its virtual DOM tree. Instead, it simply has algorithms that can determine changes in the tree and re-render. React on the web provides its own node primitives (```<div>```, ```<span>```, etc), which are the building blocks for web applications. But new node primitives can be defined, as React Native has done.

        React Native defines its own primitives (```<View>```, ```<Image>```, etc) which do not render HTML elements but instead map to native views, like UIView and UIImageView. It implements a bridge that allows the JavaScript runtime to communicate asynchronously with the native runtime. React itself provides the tree diffing and rendering infrastructure that allows React Native to work.

189. ### How to test React Native apps?

     React Native can be tested only in mobile simulators like iOS and Android. You can run the app in your mobile using expo app (https://expo.io) Where it syncs using QR code, your mobile and computer should be in same wireless network.

190. ### How to do logging in React Native?

     You can use `console.log`, `console.warn`, etc. As of React Native v0.29 you can simply run the following to see logs in the console:

     ```
     $ react-native log-ios
     $ react-native log-android
     ```

191. ### How to debug your React Native?

     Follow the below steps to debug React Native app:

     1. Run your application in the iOS simulator.
     2. Press `Command + D` and a webpage should open up at `http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui`.
     3. Enable *Pause On Caught Exceptions* for a better debugging experience.
     4. Press `Command + Option + I` to open the Chrome Developer tools, or open it via `View` -> `Developer` -> `Developer Tools`.
     5. You should now be able to debug as you normally would.
