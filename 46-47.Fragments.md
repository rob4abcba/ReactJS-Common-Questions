46. ### What are fragments?

    A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. *Fragments* let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.  
      
    RL: render() return ( requires a single parent as the toplevel ).  If you use a regular ```<div>``` as the toplevel, you will introduce an extra node in the DOM.  
    
    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <ChildA />
          <ChildB />
          <ChildC />
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
    After you render the above code, if you use right mouse button click then "Inspect", you will see the extra parent <div> in your Dev Tools depiction of the DOM tree.  
    
        To solve this, instead of wrapping the children within a <div> (shown above), wrap them in a React.Fragment (shown below).  

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return (
        <React.Fragment>
          <ChildA />
          <ChildB />
          <ChildC />
        </React.Fragment>
      )
    }
    ```

    There is also a *shorter syntax*, but it's not supported in many tools:  (RL: Also, the shorter syntax with the empty angle brackets doesn't allow you to enter a key parameter.)  

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return (
        <>
          <ChildA />
          <ChildB />
          <ChildC />
        </>
      )
    }
    ```

47. ### Why fragments are better than container divs?

    1. Fragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node. This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.
    2. Some CSS mechanisms like *Flexbox* and *CSS Grid* have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.
    3. The DOM Inspector is less cluttered.  (RL: You don't see as many extra enclosing <div></div> parents when you RMB click Inspect the element.)
