46. ### What are fragments?

    It's common pattern in React which is used for a component to return multiple elements. *Fragments* let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. (RL: render() return ( requires a single parent as the toplevel ).  If you use a regular <div> as the toplevel, you will introduce an extra node in the DOM.)

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return (
        <React.Fragment>
          <ChildA />
          <ChildB />
          <ChildC />
        </React.Fragment>
      )
    }
    ```

    There is also a *shorter syntax*, but it's not supported in many tools:  (RL: Also

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return (
        <>
          <ChildA />
          <ChildB />
          <ChildC />
        </>
      )
    }
    ```

47. ### Why fragments are better than container divs?

    1. Fragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node. This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.
    2. Some CSS mechanisms like *Flexbox* and *CSS Grid* have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.
    3. The DOM Inspector is less cluttered.
